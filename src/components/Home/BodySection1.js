                                communicate with you and each other. Some devices connect via Ethernet, but the majority use
                                wi-fi, so stable wi-fi is crucial to a smart home.<br />
                                If your broadband is the heart of your network, your smartphone is the control. Connected devices
                                come with apps you can use to control them from remotely anywhere - as long as you have an internet
                                connection.

                                provide additional services such as remote surveillance of security cameras over the Internet, or
                                access control and central locking of all perimeter doors and windows.

                            <p>Having a home security system should be a necessity in today’s world. Without a security system, you
                                put your family and property at risk. In fact, homes are 300% more likely to be burglarized if they
                                don’t have alarms, according to Alarms.org. When getting a home security system, one of the questions
                                customers have on their mind is if they need a phone line. Since many people don’t have a landline
                                these days, they may be wondering about their options when it comes to securing their home. Don’t worry;
                                there are options for home security systems without phone lines!

                            <p>24/7 home security monitoring connects you to your security system via any web-enabled computer or mobile
                                device. No matter where you are, you have secure access to your home, allowing you to monitor and control
                                your security system, whether by viewing pictures or watching live video of your home, or setting up a
                                schedule to turn on the lights, at any time, day or night. Basically, 24/7 monitoring gives you direct and
                                immediate access to your security system, and in the case of a triggered sensor in your home, an alarm
                                signal is sent to you and, if needed, emergency services are alerted and will be on their way.
